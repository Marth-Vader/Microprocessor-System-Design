ItsLit5 Specification

Objective: Implement a simple speed-reading memory game using mbed objects DigitalOut and SPI. The game consists of 9 rounds, with each round 75% the rate of the previous round. For each round, the mbed selects a sequence of 5 letters (using A-D0), and displays them on the 7-segment display. The display is briefly blanked in between each letter. Then the player should press the switches corresponding to the letters A-D in the order of the displayed letters. If the player is correct, the next round will being. Otherwise, the game is over and the number of rounds the player survive is shown.

Setup: the mbed operates as an SPI master and the 74HC595 (mode 0, active low slave select on p14) and 74HC165 (mode 2, active high slave select on p15) operate as SPI slave devices. The 74HC595 expects an 8-bit message from the mbed and uses this to control the display. Bit 0 controls segment A, bit 1 controls segment B, etc.. But 7 controls the decimal point. This slave does not sent data to the mbed. The display only updates at the end of the message. The 74HC165 sends a 4-bit message to the mbed, reporting the state of the 4 switches. Bit 0 reports state of swtich A, bit 1 repots state of switch B, etc.. This slave ignores data sent from the master.
